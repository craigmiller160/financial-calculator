Past Total Income = (paycheckGrossPay * numChecks) + bonuses
Past Total 401k = totalIncome * rate401k
Past Benefits Total = sumBenefits * numChecks
Past Taxable Income = totalIncome - (totalIncome * ssnRate) - (totalIncome * medRate) - benefitsTotal - past401k

Future Total Income = (paycheckGrossPay * numChecks) + bonuses
Future Benefits Total = sumBenefits * numChecks
Remaining 401k = 20500 - past401k
401k Percent = Loop (start = 0.1, increment = +0.1, stop = (value * totalIncome) + past401 > 20500)
    - NOTE: go back 0.1 after the above calculation
Future Taxable Income = totalIncome - (totalIncome * ssnRate) - (totalIncome * medRate) - benefitsTotal - future401k

Total Taxable Income = pastTaxableIncome + futureTaxableIncome
Tax Rate = totalTaxableIncome compared to tax rate brackets
Total Taxes = totalTaxableIncome * tax rate OR just use the tax brackets and ignore effective tax rate
    - NOTE: Probably would be easier to do total taxes and then calculate effective tax rate from that
New Take Home = futurePaycheckGrossPay - benefitsTotal - (futurePaycheckGrossPay * ssnRate) - (futurePaycheckGrossPay * medRate) - (futurePaycheckGrossPay * rate401k)
